Privacy-focused Android app that intercepts social media URLs and redirects them to privacy-friendly alternative frontends while removing tracking parameters. No apps or accounts needed to access the content shared with you.

### Smart URL Cleaning
Automatically removes tracking parameters from all URLs:
- UTM parameters (utm_source, utm_medium, etc.)
- Platform-specific trackers (Twitter s/t, YouTube si, Instagram igsh)
- E-commerce tracking (Amazon, affiliate links)
- Analytics parameters

### Automation
Granular control over how URLs are processed:
- Unshorten URLs: Automatically resolves shortened links (bit.ly, t.co, etc.)
- Remove Tracking: Strip analytics and tracking parameters
- Immediate Navigation: Automatically open the processed URL in your browser

### Privacy-Focused Redirects
Alternative frontends create a less cluttered web experience; bypassing closed ecosystems and promoting a more open internet. Sidestep supports several major platforms with configurable alternative frontends: Twitter/X (Nitter), Reddit (Redlib), YouTube (Invidious, Piped), Google Maps (OpenStreetMap), IMDb (LibreMDB), Medium (Scribe), Wikipedia (Wikiless), Goodreads (BiblioReads), Genius (Dumb, Intellectual), Tumblr (Priviblur), UrbanDictionary (RuralDictionary), Imgur (Rimgo), GitHub (GotHub), and StackOverflow (AnonymousOverflow).

### Features
- Clean Only Mode: Remove tracking without redirecting
- Clean & Sidestep Mode: Remove tracking AND redirect to alternative frontend
- Custom Redirects: Add your own domain mappings
- Instance Picker: Fetch live, healthy instances sorted by uptime
- History & Previews: Track processed links with rich metadata fetched via DuckDuckGo (optional)
